## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

 This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge and was the first time I used the skills learned on Codecademy. It was also the first time I had used Visual Studio Code as opposed to the Codecademy built-in text editor. This was a steep learning curve and one that I am sure to continue improving as I complete more projects with the tool. 
  
  This was also an introduction to Git, GitHub and the terminal, which I have found particularly challenging to get my head around, and is still an area of improvement for me.
  
  I feel the mobile responsiveness of this project was very successful and enjoyed learning about and implementing media queries, I am looking forward to using them in more complex ways in the future.

### Continued development

- Git and GitHub
- Terminal and command line

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - I often find myself on MDN Web Docs, this page on media queries was particularly useful.
- [3 Skills That Will Help You Succeed as a Junior Developer (UK)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0Erp3w8qu4&t=973s) - Code Creative is a youtube channel started by a fellow self-taught web developer. His content is geared specifically to those who are self-taught/ teaching, so is perfect for me. This video helped me to understand Git, GitHub and the terminal.
